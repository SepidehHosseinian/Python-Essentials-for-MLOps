    :param configuration: Fully specified configuration information for the
     run. Even when that information
     is contained in configuration files within the project folder, the client
     collapses
     it all and inlines it into the run definition when submitting a run.
    :type configuration: ~_restclient.models.RunConfiguration
    :param snapshot_id: Snapshots are user project folders that have been
     uploaded to the cloud for subsequent
     execution. This field is required when executing against cloud-based
     compute targets
     unless the run submission was against the API endpoint that takes a zipped
     project folder
     inline with the request.
    :type snapshot_id: str
    :param snapshots: The code snapshots that have been uploaded to the cloud
     for subsequent execution.

    :param parent_run_id: Specifies that the run history entry for this
     execution should be scoped within
     an existing run as a child. Defaults to null, meaning the run has no
     parent.
     This is intended for first-party service integration, not third-party API
     users.
    :type parent_run_id: str
    :param run_type: Specifies the runsource property for this run. The
     default value is "experiment" if not specified.
    :type run_type: str
    :param primary_metric_name: PrimaryMetricName defined by the user.
    :type primary_metric_name: str
    :param description: Description provided by the user for the run.
    :type description: str
    :param properties: Any Properties users like to add to the run. This is an
     immutable property.
    :type properties: dict[str, str]
